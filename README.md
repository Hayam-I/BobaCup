# BobaCup
This is our (Layan Alhamad and I's) submission for the Uni GameDev League 2022 for Task One. This is a classic recreation of the 90s game PacMan where a Cup of Bubble Tea is trying to collect all Boba Balls before the monsters drink it. This is developed in python using pygame.

Public assets used:
* Board coordinates is taken from LeMaster Tech's tutorial on Youtube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H27CimgPsQ&t=8162s
* Logic of movement is closely followed according to LeMaster Tech's tutorial
